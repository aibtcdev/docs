A comprehensive glossary of terms used across the AIBTC ecosystem, organized by category.

## Standards & Specifications

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **SIP** | Stacks Improvement Proposal. The formal process for proposing changes to the Stacks protocol. |
| **ERC-8004** | Ethereum standard for agent payments, enabling AI agents to pay for API access. AIBTC is implementing this on Stacks. |
| **CAIP** | Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal. Standards for cross-chain interoperability from the <a href="https://chainagnostic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance</a>. |
| **CAIP-2** | Standard for blockchain network identifiers. Example: `stacks:1` (mainnet), `stacks:2147483648` (testnet). |
| **CAIP-19** | Standard for asset identifiers across blockchains. Enables universal token addressing. |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol. Anthropic's protocol for AI models to interact with external tools and data sources. |
| **MCP Server** | Server implementing MCP that exposes tools and resources to AI agents like Claude. |

## Protocol & Payment

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **x402** | Payment protocol enabling pay-per-use APIs via HTTP 402 status codes. Agents pay per request using blockchain tokens. See the <a href="https://www.x402.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x402 specification</a>. |
| **HTTP 402** | "Payment Required" status code. The x402 protocol returns this when payment is needed to access an endpoint. |
| **Facilitator** | Service that verifies and settles x402 payments. Confirms transaction validity before granting API access. |
| **Settlement** | The process of verifying a payment transaction on-chain and confirming it with the facilitator. |
| **Payer** | The entity (usually an AI agent) making payments to access x402-protected APIs. |
| **Payment-Signature** | HTTP header containing the signed payment transaction for x402 requests. |
| **Sponsored Transaction** | A transaction where a third party (sponsor) pays the network fees on behalf of the sender. |
| **Gasless** | Transactions that don't require the sender to hold native tokens for fees (fees paid by sponsor). |
| **Price Estimate** | Pre-calculated cost for an API request, returned in 402 responses to help payers prepare payment. |
| **Pricing Tier** | Classification of endpoint costs: `free` (0), `standard` (0.001 STX), or `dynamic` (varies by usage). |

## Blockchain & Tokens

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Stacks** | Layer 2 blockchain that brings smart contracts to Bitcoin. Uses Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus. |
| **STX** | Native token of the Stacks blockchain. Used for transaction fees and smart contract execution. |
| **sBTC** | Synthetic Bitcoin on Stacks. 1:1 backed by BTC, enabling Bitcoin in smart contracts. |
| **USDCx** | Bridged USDC stablecoin on Stacks. Pegged 1:1 to USD. |
| **Clarity** | Smart contract language for Stacks. Decidable, non-Turing complete, with predictable execution. |
| **SIP-018** | Stacks Improvement Proposal for signed structured data. Enables meta-transactions and off-chain signatures. |
| **BNS** | Bitcoin Name System. Decentralized naming on Stacks (e.g., `name.btc`). |
| **Nonce** | Transaction sequence number preventing replay attacks. Increments with each transaction from an address. |
| **Mainnet** | Production Stacks network. Uses real STX, connects to Bitcoin mainnet. |
| **Testnet** | Development Stacks network. Uses test STX, safe for experimentation. |

## Tokens & Contracts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Token Type** | Payment method identifier: `stx`, `sbtc`, or `usdcx`. |
| **Token Contract** | Smart contract address for fungible tokens (sBTC, USDCx). STX is native, no contract needed. |

## Infrastructure & Cloudflare

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Serverless compute platform running at the edge. V8 isolate-based, near-zero cold starts. |
| **Durable Objects** | Cloudflare's stateful compute primitive. Single-threaded, globally unique, with SQLite storage. |
| **KV Namespace** | Cloudflare's key-value store. Eventually consistent, optimized for reads. |
| **Service Binding** | Worker-to-worker RPC connection. Enables direct function calls between Workers. |
| **Wrangler** | Cloudflare's CLI tool for developing and deploying Workers. |
| **Binding** | Configuration connecting a Worker to resources (KV, Durable Objects, services, secrets). |

## Frameworks & Libraries

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Hono** | Lightweight web framework for Cloudflare Workers. Fast routing, middleware support. |
| **Chanfana** | OpenAPI framework for Cloudflare Workers. Auto-generates API documentation. |
| **Astro** | Static site generator with partial hydration. Powers the docs site. |
| **Starlight** | Astro's documentation theme. Built-in search, navigation, and dark mode. |

## API Services

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Hiro API** | Blockchain data API for Stacks. Provides transaction, address, and contract data. |
| **OpenRouter** | LLM aggregation service. Unified API for multiple AI models with usage-based pricing. |
| **Tenero API** | Market data service for Stacks ecosystem. Token prices, trading analytics, wallet data. |

## Storage Categories (x402-api)

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **KV** | Simple key-value storage. Set, get, list, delete operations per payer. |
| **Paste** | Text snippet storage with optional expiration. Like pastebin for agents. |
| **DB** | SQLite-backed structured storage. Query with SQL, per-payer isolation. |
| **Queue** | FIFO message queue. Push, pop, peek operations for async workflows. |
| **Sync** | Real-time synchronization. Pub/sub pattern for coordinating agents. |
| **Memory** | Vector storage with embeddings. Semantic search and retrieval. |

## Endpoint Categories (x402-api)
