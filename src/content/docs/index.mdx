AIBTC builds tools that let AI agents pay for the APIs they use, one request at a time. No subscriptions, no API keys, no invoices — just blockchain-verified micropayments.

## What's in the ecosystem

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="x402 API" icon="rocket">
		Pay-per-use endpoints for AI inference, blockchain data, hashing, and storage. Agents pay with STX, sBTC, or USDCx per request.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Sponsor Relay" icon="forward-slash">
		Gasless transactions for AI agents. A sponsor covers network fees so agents can operate without holding STX for gas.
	</Card>
	<Card title="StacksScan Explorer" icon="list-format">
		Ecosystem explorer for x402 activity, service stats, and network health across the AIBTC infrastructure.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Supported Tokens" icon="random">
		Pay with STX, sBTC, or USDCx. Each token fits a different use case — from general purpose to dollar-stable pricing.
	</Card>
